There are some makefile based projects and some are Xcode projects.

Makefile project, are command-line based, so corresponding shell script is included for building binary. This further gives insight to the command-line build system [CMD folder]

Xcode projects, can be opened up using the *.xcodeproj files on Macintosh (or you can possibly open add the include and source paths in the new project that you create in xcode, as project-settings-file contain local path, and might not run/compile well). [XCODE folder]
